## Overview

The Website Ta'aruf Padi Melati is an online platform established to facilitate the process of Ta'aruf (Islamic introduction for marriage) strictly according to Sharia principles. The platform is formally linked to the Muhammadiyah autonomous organizations, namely Nasyiatul Aisyiyah and Pemuda Muhammadiyah, aiming to assist their cadres in finding life partners while supporting organizational regeneration efforts.
